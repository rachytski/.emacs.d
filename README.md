# .emacs.d

A single source of truth for all my personal emacs settings.

For the ELPA package management use Emacs with version >=24. Some packages (like irony) require more recent Emacs versions as they depend on some bugfixes. The lowest workable version for the configuration in this repo is 24.5.

For a snapshot of packages in a well known state use personal-elpa repo (git@github.com:rachytski/elpa-personal)
